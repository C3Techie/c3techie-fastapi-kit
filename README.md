# 🚀 FastAPI Backend Project Setup

This project is a scalable FastAPI backend built with best practices using:

- `venv` for isolated Python environments
- `Poetry` for dependency management
- `run.py` for cross-platform development startup

---

## 🖥️ Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

> ✅ If you're setting up the project for use or deployment, **clone the main repository**.  
> 🔁 If you're contributing, please follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) instead.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org-or-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

---

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate it
# macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

# Windows:
env\Scripts\Activate
```

---

### 3. Install Poetry

Install Poetry globally if you don't have it already:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Check the installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

---

### 4. Install Project Dependencies

Use Poetry to install the project’s dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

---

### 5. Run the Development Server

Use the `run.py` script to start the FastAPI app:

```bash
poetry run python run.py
```

Once started, the app will be available at:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
