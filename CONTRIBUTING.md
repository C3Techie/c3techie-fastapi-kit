## 📌 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the GitHub page.

### 2. Create an Issue

- Describe your proposed feature, bug, or enhancement.
- Assign appropriate labels like `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, etc.
- Wait for a maintainer to assign or approve the issue.

### 3. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name
```

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Follow existing file structure and style.
- Write tests for your changes (if applicable).

### 6. Push and Open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-task-name
```

Then go to GitHub and open a Pull Request:

- Reference the issue number (e.g., `Fixes #12`)
- Describe what you did and why
- Wait for code review

### 7. CI Checks

Your pull request will be automatically tested using GitHub Actions:

- ✅ Linting
- ✅ Tests
- ✅ Build validation

Make sure all checks pass before requesting a merge.

## ✅ Additional Guidelines

- Use clear commit messages (e.g., `feat(auth): add login endpoint`)
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Sync your fork with the `main` branch regularly

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```
